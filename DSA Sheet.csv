Problem Statement,Key Points to solve,Solution,Comment,Time Complexity
Search element in sorted array,Sorted Array,"find mid and define low and high for each loop while low <= high
both iterative (better bcz of space complexity) or recursive approach","Compare with binary tree
Max no of iterations --> height of binary tree --> ceiling [log2n]
log2n time complexity",O(log n)
Search First/Last Occurrence of element in sorted array,Sorted Array,"same as binary search
just check if left/right element of mid is same element or not",corner case -> if mid == 0 then code should not check for -1 index and if mid == length of array then should not check for +1 index,O(log n)
Count of occurrences of a number in sorted array,Sorted Array,"first occurrence, last occurrence and difference","corner case -> if first occurrence is -1 then return -1, don't search for last occurrence",O(log n)
Count of occurrences of 1 in sorted binary array,Sorted Array,First occurrence of 1 -> length - index of first occurrence of 1,"corner case -> -1 if 1 is not present, 
only 2 conditions to be checked either value is 1 or 0",O(log n)
Square root of a number to floor integer value,Sorted Array,from 0 to num/2 use binary search and find number whose sq is closest to num.,maintain a var result -> update it only if sq of mid < num,O(log n)
Search in infinite sized sorted array,Sorted Array,"Go to index 1, search element, if not found, go to index*2 index and then search and compare values","Instead of dividing the array by 2, we raise index by 2 and then apply binary search
Corner Case -> For first index (0), check with condition bcz we need to multiply index by 2 on each iteration. So start with 1",O(log k) where k is position/index of value
Find any peak element,NON Sorted Array,"Go to mid, go the side where element is bigger","corner case -> handle first and last index cases as well, 
We only find first peak element using this approach",O(log n)
Search in sorted rotated array,Sorted Rotated Array,"Go to mid, go the corner elements and compare the value with num",,O(log n)
Find if there is pair with sum x in sorted array,"Sorted Array
Pair with given sum","Take 2 pointers at 2 ends, increase low or decrease high based on sum value",while (low < high),O(n)
Find if there is triplet with sum x in sorted array,"Sorted Array
Triplet with given sum","Go from left to right, find pair with sum (x-currentIndexValue)","Run loop from 0 to n-3 and call pair sum for the remaining array.
Pass low and high as param to pair with given sum func",O(n^2)
Median of 2 sorted arrays,,Find mid for both and do left/right in shorter array based on whether all left side of both arrays is less than mid point of shorter array,,
